Nice Work!<br>\r\nNow I'm having this problem: I've added a List Control to the dialog but I can't work with it on the code. the CListBox or the CListCtr need an afxwin or afxcmm to be included.\r\n<br>\r\nSo far so good, but as soon as do that I start to have problems related to WINDOWS.H been already included. This made me change the definition of my project to have the MFC Libraries as a Shared DLL.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes anyone has an idea for working with those controls using your solution? 'Have been looking around and trying to find an answer but still nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the SetWindowText Function I've been able to populate the labels and textboxes... so far!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks all!</p>\r\n",
