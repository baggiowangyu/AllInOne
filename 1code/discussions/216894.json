And application is communicates with the object running on the same address space, not the original COM Server which is shared by all the MFC applications.\r\n\r\nCan any one sched some light on this.\r\n\r\nMy intention is, i would like to share the data between C# and MFC application.\r\n\r\nThanks in Advance.\r\nAnbhu\r\n",
