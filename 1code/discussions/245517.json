My ActiveX control was written in C# based off the example in the All-In-One code framework. In certain cases I observed that my\r\n application is not able to receive the events being fired by the ActiveX control, and as far as I can tell this happens at completely random points. Some runs it works fine, and then others it doesn't. Has anyone encountered similar problems with the C# ActiveX\r\n control? I know that I have mentioned nothing specific about my problem, but I thought to wait and see if this thread gets any responses and then to go into the gory details.</p>\r\n",
