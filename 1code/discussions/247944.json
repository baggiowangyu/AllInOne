It is working fine but for one problem. I have finally a CSdll.dll, CPPWrapperdll.dll and  CConsoleApp.exe. I placed the CSdll.dll and CPPWrapperdll.dll in system32 directory. <br /> <br /> When i run the CConsoleApp.exe it is unable to find CSdll.dll. If I place the CConsoleApp.exe and CSdll.dll in the same folder and CPPWrapperdll.dll in system32 it works. I need to place all the dlls in system32. Am I missing something????</p>",
