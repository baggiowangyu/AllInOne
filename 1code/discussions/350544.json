If it is we would go to the ADMIN\r\n side and mark it complete.</p>\r\n<p>2) If it is not in our database it would show pending status we would get the document upload it so they can be available for them to download and make it complete.</p>\r\n<p>Note: Every order would be Pending or Preliminary until we make it complete.</p>\r\n<p>More info on project to who might be intrested,,please be in US east coast</p>\r\n",
