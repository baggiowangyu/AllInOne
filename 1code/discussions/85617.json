See CppNamedPipeClient, CppNamedPipeServer, CSNamedPipeClient, CSNamedPipeServer samples. These C++ C# named pipe client and server can communicate with each other.</p>\r\n<p>If the applications are on the internet env, you need socket. Currently, I do not have a sample to demo socket communication between .NET and C++ app in All-In-One Code Framework. You can try searching it on the internet.</p>\r\n<p>If you have any feedback or suggestions for the All-In-One Code Framework project, please email it to <a href=\"mailto:codefxf@microsoft.com\">codefxf@microsoft.com</a></p>\r\n<p>Regards<br>Jialiang Ge</p>",
