I tried the CSActiveX sample and embedded the object in a test htm page and could&nbsp;access the properties (FloatProperty and ForeColor) successfully. However, when I invoke the Refresh() or HelloWorld() methods on the object, I get &quot;Object doesn't support this property or method&quot; error. What could be going wrong here? I am running IE8 on windows 7. I am guessing something security related?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",
