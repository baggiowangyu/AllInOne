I tried the following (a modification to your .vbs script) but got an ActiveX error 429&nbsp; - could not create activex component.</p>\r\n<p>'&nbsp;This works fine i.e. create instance of object.<br>SET obj = CreateObject(&quot;CSExeCOMServer.CSSimpleObject&quot;)<br>'&nbsp;Error 429 occurs here.<br>SET anotherobj = GetObject(,&quot;CSExeCOMServer.CSSimpleObject&quot;)<br>' call the HelloWorld method that returns a string<br>MsgBox &quot;The HelloWorld method returns &quot; &amp; anotherobj .HelloWorld</p>\r\n<p>I have done some research on this but there does not seem to be much info for doing this apart from one approach which is to create a VB6 wrapper, which I have not yet tried (I need to get hold of VB6) but would not be as elegant as your CSExeCOMServer approach if only I could use it with GetObject.</p>\r\n<p>My end goal is to create a single instance of the activeX exe object started from a cmd prompt and the same object can be used in different vbscripts.</p>\r\n<p>Any info you can provide would be great.<br>Many thanks.<br>Mark</p>",
