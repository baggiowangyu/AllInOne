Some blocks of course fit in this role better than others (and some not at all), but most of the &quot;reference implementation &#43; guidance&quot;\r\n comes crystal clear and reusable when abstract-automated.</p>\r\n<p>Let me know, if you're interested to hear more. I'll be happy to explain.</p>\r\n<p>Kalle Launiala</p>\r\n",
