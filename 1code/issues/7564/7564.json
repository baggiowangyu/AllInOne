    "Description": "Creating a treeview in Silverlight using the treeview is easy but creating a complete CRUD treeview is a common need with hardly any sample that does it completely.  So a Silverlight example with ability to create new nodes (right click and create node; even right click with ChildWindow to add node is fine), ability to right click and change title of a node, ability to delete node, ability to drag & drop to rearrange the tree view nodes (the most common need that is difficult to do properly).\nÂ \nAppreciate you consideration of this request",
