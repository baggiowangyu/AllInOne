    "Description": "I'm developing native windows application with IPC based on named pipe with overlapped IO. Due to high load (2 applications sending/receiving gigabytes of data simultaneously), sometimes I had strange result codes from GetLastError() like ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED. How to handle such errors correctly? How to handle errors when client or server suddenly disconnects or stalling while sending/receiving?",
