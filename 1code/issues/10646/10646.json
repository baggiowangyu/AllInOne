    "Description": "I am new to programing and I am using VB.  The first issue that I have problems with, is being able to pass a datafield into an array.\n \nThe example I need to work on is, I have a data table with event and date fields.  I want to pass the events into a array so that I can use the upcoming event in the header of my form.  This needs to be updated automatically using formulars whenever someone opens the form.  I am certain that I can get the formulars to work, but what I have trouble with is getting the datafields into variables so that the formulars can sort out which of the events is the next event.  I have created the form with gridview that shows all the events, but I need to advertise the upcoming event.\n \nI also want to use this function to create random situations, like creating a photo database and showing random photos from that in a form.\n \nThanks in advance to anyone who can help.",
