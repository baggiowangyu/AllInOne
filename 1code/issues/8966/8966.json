      "Message": "hi ShahramJam and GARTFEO,\r\n\r\nThank you for using our code sample request service. \r\n\r\n I do know 23 design patterns when I start studying csharp 1.0 programing. But I don't know what is about the Design Patterns of csharp 4.0. If possilbly, you can tell us which one has been added into csharp 4.0. It is because that csharp has a little of changes but not all concepts. So if saying it clearly, I can submit it to our system in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\nAll-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com \r\n\r\n",
