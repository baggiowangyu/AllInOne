      "Message": "Hello dLcreations and jrajapandian,\r\n\r\nThank you for using our code sample request service. \r\n\r\nI'd like to confirm with you my understanding of the sample request:\r\n\r\nYour sample idea is simple solution looks like Alibaba.com. But I think it should contact with bank system and  cooperate with them. So this sample idea can not be composed by ourself. It is because that this project is Microsoft's project. Base on that our team should compose sample using Microsoft's technology. Although Microsoft doesn't provide support for third party software or interface. I can give you to another site that can assist you. Please access to http://www.sourcecodesworld.com/scripts/PayPal-614/. Thank again for your sample idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\nAll-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com ",
