    "Description": "I've tried to use VSTO to host WPF data grid in a Word task pane, however, I couldn't get the data to show up in the WPF control in the task pane.\n\nThe data would preview OK, but it wouldn't show up when I ran the project.\n\nI created WPF libraries, and put one in the user control, host element in the startup project. \n\nCan't get it to work.",
