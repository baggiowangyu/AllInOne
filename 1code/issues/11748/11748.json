    "Description": "System.ServiceModel.Syndication supports composition of RSS or Atom feeds however samples for extending this namespace are scant. The namespace does not apparently provide native support for extending RSS as MediaRSS for example.\n\nA sample of how inheritance and other OOP criteria is used to enable generating MediaRSS enclosures from System.ServiceModel.Syndication would be very useful to those working with XML.",
