The local sample repository is correctly set up, and when I attempt to view a sample the Download button is displayed instead of the Open button. If I download the sample it overwrites the existing pre-installed sample.\n \nThanks\n \nMike",

If you have another issue, please feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAll-In-Onecode-Framework\r\n\r\n",

      "Message": "Ok; looks like the Samples.xml is overwritten if it already exists when using the Sample Browser for the first time (when setting the samples directory). I redownloaded the All-In-One Code Framework and grabbed the Samples.xml from the archive and saved it on top of the existing one; now it is working!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMike",
