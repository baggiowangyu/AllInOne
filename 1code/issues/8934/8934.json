      "Message": "Hello shenzhongwei,\r\n\r\nThank you for using our code sample request service. \r\n\r\nI'd like to confirm with you my understanding of the sample request:\r\n\r\n  The topic you submitted is talking about how to use datatimepicker. It seems that unconventional data format should be convert to convertional data format and input the Time control. You can use If condition operation to solve this issue. It used by lots of project has same program. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAll-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com \r\n",
