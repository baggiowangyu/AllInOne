    "Description": "I'm trying to find a good example that creates a WCF Server GUI and WCF Client GUI where the client can change data on the server GUI or run the same functions that buttons on the server GUI uses.  I've been able to setup WCF server and client in console applications but I'm having trouble making the step from console applications to form/GUI applications.\n\nThanks,\nBubba",
