    "Description": "I have a French (Canadian) Windows 7 64 bits computer. When I click om program's icon, I see program's name in Process Viewer, and it suddenly disappears. I suspect it doesn't find directory and stops. In previous versions, it loaded despite this error. Now it stops and there's absolutely no way to correct settings. I've got a disk problem and I have to recreate folders names myself. I suppose Windows no longer knows Special Directory Downloads is Téléchargements in FRench.",
