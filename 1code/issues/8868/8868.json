      "Message": "Hello ONiehus,\r\n\r\nThank you for using our code sample request service. \r\n\r\nI'd like to confirm with you my understanding of the sample request:\r\n\r\nAs far as I know,You want to run a thread while loading the MainWinform windows individually. It seems that bottleneck isn't main thread because of your connecting your SQL Server should have time via different network environment. If you use remote database, you should take up more time to connect database. So I think if this is a good sample idea, we should concern with access layer not thread.\r\n\r\nIs my understanding right? Please feel free to let me know. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAll-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com",
