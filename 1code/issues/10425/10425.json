    "Description": "Can someone give me the code in C# of using this method to list labels of a particular path in TFS? I am using VS2010 connecting to TFS2010.  I am struggling with a simple example as my code doesn't compile.\n \nI just want to query labels on a path and display them.  I know I can do this in SideKicks but I need to know the code because I am going to do something deeper.  I just need help in getting started.  Please help!\n \nThanks in advance!",
