    "Description": "Hi,\nI have problem getting json data from this sample service. It appears that WebHttpRelayBinding doesn't relay json messages back to client. \nÂ \nSteps to reproduce: run sample service. Issue GET request with Accept: application/atom+xml - data is returned. Issue GET request with Accept: application/json - connection closed and nothing is returned. \nSame request to local service using WebHttpBinding returns json fine. Any suggestion on how to modify WebHttpRelayBinding to support json content type?",
