    "Description": "I have developed a master page for wiki pages using _starter_foundation.master. The requirement is I need to hide the ribbon in display mode and when the page is in edit mode, the ribbon is to be displayed. I have no access to the server, so no code behind. I need to do using javascript or some sharepoint controls. Also I have tried some controls like publishingwebcontrols:authoringcontainer and publishingwebcontrols:editmodepanel. But they didnt work.",
