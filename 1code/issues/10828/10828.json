    "Description": "Hello, \n \nI am creating a fax client app using VS2008 C++, XP SP3. The C++ example for sending a fax, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms693391(v=vs.85).aspx, compiles and executes perfectly. At this point I would like to be able to track the progress of the fax throughout transmission, i.e., capture line busy, no dialtone, and all other members of FAX_JOB_EXTENDED_STATUS_ENUM.\n \nAfter many searches of MSDN documentation, this site and other developer websites, I have been unable to find a straight-forward solution. I DO see VB examples, but I am having a difficult time translating them to VC++.\n \nIf I can be shown an example in context with the above-mentioned MSDN example, which I am also attaching, I would be greatly indebted. If this solution has already been presented, please refer me to the urls.\n \nBest Regards, \nGerry",
