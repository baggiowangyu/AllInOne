    "Description": "The new Identity system incorporated in MVC5 seems to be (at last) truly modular and customizable.\n\nCould you provide samples about implementations using an storage other than the EF/SqlServer, as you done with the infamous \"Implementing a custom Membership/Role/Profile provider\" in the previous membership system?\n\nAnother option is that you expose the code of the EF/SqlServer implementation of the identity system, so we can examine it and reimplement using different storage options (i.e. NoSql)\n\nThanks in advance",
