    "Description": "Hi,\nI have a database of events that I wish to publish as an iCalendar feed. iCalendar is a web standard for publishing event data so that it can be consumed in clients such as Outlook - read more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar\n \nI would love for you guys to publish a code sample that shows how to publish a list of events as an iCalendar feed. Assume that I have some POCO objects that contain all of the requisite info (DTSTAMP, DTSTART, DTEND, ORGANIZER etc..)\n \nThanks\nJamie Thomson",
