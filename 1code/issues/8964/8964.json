    "Description": "One of the missing controls in VS is the toolbox. Toolbox is a powerful control that would help when talking about GUI space and presentation, it wraps elements (maybe treeview elements or buttons) into a one single control that can be called with just one movement, having the ability to show, hide or switch to static.\nÂ \nI really would like to have a control like that, for me would be very useful in my apps and I still haven't found a sample code to get this control.",
