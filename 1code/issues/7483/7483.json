    "Description": "There exists a project at    http://onom.codeplex.com/   which is the OneNote Object Model  (OM) - wrapper classes over the COM API.  It is supposed to make coding much easier using this abstration wrapper.  The original \"guide\" documenting this Object model is (confirmed) lost and its link replaced to an msdn article on OneNote 2010, which discusses the COM API and briefly touches on the OM, just not detailed enough  I would like to see some coding  examples which use this OneNote Object Model - wrapper classes. included in the All-In-One Framework.",
