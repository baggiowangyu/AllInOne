    "Description": "The application does not remember the last position, height or width of the application window. IMO this should be a minimum requirement of all Windows application and it get frustrating when you have to resize the windows each time you open the application.  Especially since the default height/width does not work very well on some screens - top of screen is outside screen, and bottom edge is under the taskbar.",
