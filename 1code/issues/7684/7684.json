    "Description": "Seems to be very tricky to get list of installed bitmap encoders and decoders and other components via the IWICImagingFactory::CreateComponentEnumerator which is unavailable in WPF. The correct code with .NET 4.0 interop features would be very useful, and returning CodecInfo in the case of encoders/decoders welcomed.",

      "Message": "Hello JanKucera\r\n\r\nThank you for using our code sample request service!\r\n\r\nThere are generally two options to interop with WIC from .NET:\r\n1. Use WPF and the System.Windows.Media.Imaging namespace\r\n2. Use COm Interop with the WIC interfaces (see http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/wictools for WicCop which contains an export of all of the APIs for C#).\r\n\r\nAs you said, WPF does not expose all low-level WIC APIs (also see http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/tomershamam/archive/2007/09/21/wpf-image-processing.aspx), but the second option should probably meet your need. Could you please let me know if it meets your need? If necessary, I can write a similar code sample in All-In-One Code Framework. \r\n",
