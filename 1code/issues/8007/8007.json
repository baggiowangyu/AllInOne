    "Description": "I have created a msmq cluster with a clustered DTC service on windows 2008 R2 machine.\nI have created a transactional queue on clustered instance added my id on security tab, however kept the \"Authenticated\" option \"checked\"\nPublished a message with \"durable=true, exactlyOnce=true, useActiveDirectory=false & security mode = \"transport\" & msmqAuthenticationMode = WindowsDomain\" in the binding. \nAfter this I am unable to publish a message from a windows 2008 machine & at client side the message moves to transactional dead letter queue with error as \"the signature is invalid\" error\n \nI tried setting up the \"Authenticated option as unchecked did not help.\nThen i set authenticated unchecked and instead set the \"security mode = None\" and then i could publish message.\n \nCan you please guide me in this?",
