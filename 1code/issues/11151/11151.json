    "Description": "Dynatree is popularly used jQuery treeview. Documentation & Samples are available online.\nBut there are no easy / basic code samples or video tutorials for beginners to start with.\nWould be great if code snippets or sample for regularly used dynatree tasks are available under a single roof.\nIt would be greatly appreciated to let know if there are any other equivalent alternatives, with code samples",
