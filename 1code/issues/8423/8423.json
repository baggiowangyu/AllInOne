    "Description": "Hello,\n \nI would be interested what is the best way to\n \no Call multiple web services in an asynchronous way\no from windows.forms or WPF \no and wait untill all of them are completed and returned their result\no show the results on a Windows.Forms or WFC controls\n \nThis is a request which concerns nearly all SmartClient applications as the would like to call the webservices asynchrounously in order to limit the execution tim eto the longest of all services and not the sum of the execution time of all web services\n \nThank you in advance\n \nP. S. One problem I encountered is that Windows.Forms or WPF use Single Threaded Appartment Model and that the WaitHandle.WaitAll does not work in STA.",
