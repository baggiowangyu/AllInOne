      "Message": "Hello \r\n\r\nDoes this happen to certain samples or all samples?  I'm having difficulty to reproduce these problems on my side, however, we will very likely release a new version of Sample Browser next week.  It's completely redesigned, and hopefully, these problems will disappear in it.\r\n\r\nHello tomnicolosi\r\n\r\nThe sample browser stores the download sample info in the Samples.xml file and uses the info to determine whether a sample is downloaded or not.   That's why it's not recognized when you unpack the sample manually.\r\n\r\nJialiang Ge\r\nMicrosoft All-In-One Code Framework",
