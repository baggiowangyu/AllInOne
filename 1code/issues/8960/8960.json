    "Description": "Hi,\n \nCan you please share code for creating button having an image on it? This is to be achieved using Attached Properties.\n \nThe Button can look like the following:\n \n       <!-- Declare button with an attached image -->\n        <Button x:Name=\"btnOk\" Content=\"OK\"\n                local:MyClass.Image=\"theOk.png\"\n                Style=\"{DynamicResource MyImageButton}\" />\n \nNote: I don't have blend and I have restrictions in installing it. So the solution should not be using blend.\nNote: I am using Silverlight 3\nNote: Please ensure that you are posting code for Silverlight 3; not WPF\nNote: Please do NOT provide any reference to any article. I am looking for complete code listed in this post.\nNote: The attached property is to be used by a standard button(<Button>); not inherited custom control.\n \nThanks\nLijo",
