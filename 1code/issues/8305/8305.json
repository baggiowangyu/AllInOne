As far as I know,VB6 couldn't convert into NET framework.It is because that VB 6 language isn't Oriented interfaces and it cann't implement  multiple interfaces.So vb6 language and VB.NET are two varity language in fact.You can refactor your logic and implement it in  NET develop tool .\r\n\r\nIs my understanding correct? Please let me know if I misunderstood your needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAll-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com ",
