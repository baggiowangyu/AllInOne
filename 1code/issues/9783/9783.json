    "Description": "A custom SecurityTokenCache is needed to leverage WIF's IsSessionMode feature in a web-farm environment.  Several Microsoft employees have either implemented or described implementing such a cache however no samples can be found on the web other than the small snippets that appear in Hervey Wilson's PDC 2009 session.\n \nPlease share Hervey's TableSecurityTokenCache or something similar.\n \nThis request appears in the following forums:\n \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8015542/azure-web-farm-ready-securitytokencache\nhttp://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/Geneva/thread/a74117a8-2981-498e-8d2f-b95cd55a0e46\nhttp://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazuresecurity/thread/5017a7ba-3526-48ab-b6cc-992068d0770a\nhttp://identityserver.codeplex.com/discussions/278492\n \nThanks!\n \njd",
