    "Description": "Hello,  I'm trying to figure out SL4 Business Application (I think this is also called WCF - RIA  *please correct me if I'm wrong, this is part of my problem trying to find examples) and I'm having issue's with creating treeviews from a query (domain service).  I've tried to use the group-by with a datagrid, but I don't like not being able to change the column names and I can't figure out how to add a check-box.  I'm using VB.  Is there anyway to have a demo of creating a tree with two queries ? (in VB preferably)\n \nI'm also having issues with the return type of IQueryable in that if I try to just select one column from my table, I must change the type to a IQueryable(of String) which is then not auto generated - it seems only IQueryable(of tablename) starting with the word Get are autogenerated.  \n \nAre either of these issues different with SL5 ?\n \nThank you for your time",
