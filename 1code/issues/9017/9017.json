      "Message": "Hi mdheerajgupta ,\r\n\r\nThank you for using our code sample request service. \r\n\r\n It seems that you use ServiceBase baseclass to run the windows service such as \"ServiceBase.Run(new WindowsService());\". Are you sure you set the CanHandlePowerEvent ,CanHandleSessionChangeEvent,CanPauseAndContinue,CanShutdown and CanStop into true.\r\nI think these property is critical program about how to resolve running the Lockworstation win32 function. If possibly, you can attach your program code to this thread,From that we can locate at the key of error point in order to resolve it.Currently, it seems that it is a good sample idea to submitted. Thanks for your additional information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\nAll-In-OneCode Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com ",
