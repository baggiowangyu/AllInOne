    "Description": "I have an application that a nonadmin should be able to use to launch a program requiring admin elevation as an admin.  I've setup impersonation through an impersonator class and call it when I click a button to launch the specific program.  When the program launches it seems fine but when I click the button I get an error saying the program requires elevation.  I don't mind a UAC prompt asking for elevation I just don't want the nonadmin user to have to put in credentials.  Please look at my code and see what I'm doing wrong.",
