    "Description": "I was hoping that there would be a possibility of a code sample on how one can hook into a D3D game (be it DX9, 10, or 11), and capture the video output. Either as a single frame, or a stream, with the ability to capture while full screen, hidden behind another window, or even to capture only a rectangle section of the stream specifically. All of this, without causing a huge amount of latency (I'd like to be able to present the stream at a watchable frame rate, on a GDI, -or- WPF form, as well as not lag out the target game)\nÂ \nThanks in advanced!",
