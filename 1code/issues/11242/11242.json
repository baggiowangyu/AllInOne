    "Description": "I'd like to see how to write a code editor keyboard macro as a VS2012 plug-in. It should work as follows:\n\nPress an arbitrary key combination to begin recording keystrokes.\nPress a different arbitrary key combination to stop recording keystrokes.\nPress yet another different key combination to play back the recorded keystrokes.",
