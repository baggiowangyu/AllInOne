    "Description": "Tranfer BusinessObjects from one PC to another. \n\nI thought on:\n1.serialize a BO object\n2.transfer it to another PC\n3.deserialize it with correct type, so that a object.consistencyCheck() method can be called\n4.make a consistency check \n(enhanced: call aditional data from sender which is missing)\n5.save to db\n\nThe thing with the type would make it more interesting. If using WCF i mostly use a method for each BO. But think on an incresing number of BO. So the transfer of the objects shoudl be independend of the type.",
