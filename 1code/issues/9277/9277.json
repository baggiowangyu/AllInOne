      "Message": "Hi all,\r\n Thank you for supporting our project. I am sorry I have a delay response due to my unffamiliarity with this technology.Currently, Now I can tell you I have found some of its solution when I crawl our MSDN forum ,there are serial solutions for it as follows:\r\nhttp://www.codeproject.com/KB/audio-video/VFWWebcam.aspx\r\n\r\nBased on my past experience, WIC has enough official document support this topic,and DirectShow will be replaced by Media Founation API,so it is not make sense. As far as I know VFW is a good solution for it,and you can easy find out its related explanation about its API such as:\r\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd318186(v=VS.85).aspx\r\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms713481.aspx\r\n\r\nI will try my best submitting it as a new sample idea, hope it approval by subject matter experts .\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAll-In-Onecode Framework",
