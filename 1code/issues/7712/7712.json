      "Message": "Hello vinayakbaddi \r\n\r\nWelcome to request the code samples. \r\n\r\nThe MediaElement.Source property cannot understand a video file without file extension. You have to pass a video file with file extension to it. May I know why you can't have file extensions? Will such a code sample help you: demos how to detect the video format from a file without file extension, then rename the file appropriate and pass the new file name to MediaElement.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJialiang Ge\r\nMicrosoft All-In-One Code Framework",
