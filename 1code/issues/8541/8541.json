Your topic metioned above is outside the scope, but what i can do is informing  you to access http://www.microsoft.com/msdn or http://stackoverflow.com/ and  look for your issue answer. And I have used jquery-1.4.1.min.js a few years ago, you may not refer the GAC for System.ServiceModel.Web.resources.dll.There is another possibility.you may not initial object and set value to it. How about if you do this operation? would that work for you? \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAll-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com ",
