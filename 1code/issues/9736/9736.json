    "Description": "I want a gridview which looks like treeview with gridview .\n \nlets call it as TreeGrid. \n \n I require this for showing hierarchical data.\nTo get idea on how i want, please look into this link\n \nhttp://examples.ext.net/#/TreePanel/Advanced/TreeGrid/\n \nI am using VS2008. ASP.NET and C#\n \nis it possible to implement such features with asp.net controls? Please provide me some sample to generate such functionality. I will have the data in datatables and when the user clicks on the node then only the correspinding data for node should be populated in the grid.\n \nEdit:  for the above implementation I also want first column of the treegrid (tree node column) to be locked. which means if the grid has so many columns then i want to freeze the first column of the treegrid and remaining columns should be scrollable.\nsee this example. It might help you to get some idea.\nhttp://examples.ext.net/#/GridPanel/Miscellaneous/LockingGridView/\n \nwhich means i want the combined features of the provided two links for the treegrid.\n \nPlease provide some example code. I am stuck with this..\n \nThank you.",
