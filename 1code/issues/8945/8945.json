    "Description": "We have a WCF service which should serve as middle-tier between client and database. All communication with DB needs to go through this WCF service. We need transfer of small object as well as transfer of large collections representing content loaded from DB. We are using proxy generated by web reference on the client. The item count in the list may be in special cases up to 300.000. The data transfer should be as fast as possible.\n \nThe problem is in transfering large collections. We don't want to use big limit numbers in config file since we believe it's not the right way.\nI have found some idea of solution on http://www.codeguru.com/forum/showpost.php?p=1789375&postcount=17 using 'reverse channel' but I have no idea how to implement it. Another thing is that we should be able to provide to the client synchronous methods for getting such collections.\n \nAnd may be the last thing - we'd like to use PerSession InstanceContextMode",
