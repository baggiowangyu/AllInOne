    "Description": "Hi there,\n \nI need to show image files that are stored in a remote SharePoint directory in a server located across the world. My solution is being developped in VS 2010 C# .NetFramework 4.\n \nI have no familiarity with SharePoint, so I do not know where to start. I plan to open the images in a browser window inside my app. I do not necessarily want to download the files, once it could be a slow process because some of them are large. If I could just show them inside a web browser window inside my app would be more than enough.\n \nThanks for any support.\n \nEduardo Quintana",
