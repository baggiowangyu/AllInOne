    "Description": "Hi,\n \nTo secure my tiles, i need to implement signature token with my tile path. I am using amazon storage. All my tiles are stored in amazon S3 and cloudFront and they are private. To access them i need to put signature token after the tile's path. I have created a custom tile source which put the signature after tile's path and it is working well with single image i mean with dzi. Now i need it to implement for collection, i mean for dzc. But i can not create a custom tile source for collection image. \n \nCan anyone help me to create a custom tile source for collection base deepzoom image. Please help me to accomplish it. I need it ASAP.\n \n \n \nregards\n \nHabib",
