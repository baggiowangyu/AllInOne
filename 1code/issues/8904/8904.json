      "Message": "Hello CodeTwo,\r\n\r\nThank you for using our code sample request service. \r\n\r\nI'd like to confirm with you my understanding of the sample request:\r\n\r\nThe topic  which you posted is about directshow. It should use c++ language to compose it, so it is hard to compose only by csharp language.I can tell you a good news,sourceforge has directshow.net package used to do this one. And you can use WPF MediaKit such as http://wpfmediakit.codeplex.com/. We recommend the lastest one because of its my brother project. I will dig into it with researching. If it is escalated by other one, I will post it. Thanks for your supporting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAll-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com ",
