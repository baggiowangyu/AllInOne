    "Description": "There is a lot of confusion/debate found after I've done some research on how to properly receive data with SerialPort in .Net. Because serial ports aren't used as often now, there is a large lack of documentation and code examples that handle data receiving in the proper way. Personally, I'm interested in modem communication because I'm updating legacy systems with .Net code that use serial modems and POTS.",
