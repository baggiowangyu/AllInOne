      "Message": "hi doorscomputers,\r\n\r\nThank you for using our code sample request service. \r\nThe issue which you mentioned is noticed by me. I have submitted it yesterday. this issue should use FindFirstPrinterChangeNotification and FindNextPrinterChangeNotification to notify system to the printer queue has changed. If the sample idea that I have submitted yesterday is approved by our expert. Next step our software engineer will compose it and release it .You can click the brand button which name is Downloads to get them. This sample idea can change the printer setting such as priority. After adding these characteristicses,you can find this one would be better than a only printer queue monitor.Thanks for concernating on our project and providing so wonderful sample idea. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a good day\r\nAll-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com ",
