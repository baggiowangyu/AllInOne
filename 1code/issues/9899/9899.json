    "Description": "I am trying to force Code Review at Check-in Process.\nI have managed to implement it in TFS 2010, using StyleCop and the tool \"StyleCop Team Foundation Server check-in policy\".\nRef: http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/StyleCopPolicy/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=4204\n \nNow I am trying to implement the same in SVN & CVS.\nI prefer to stick on with StyleCop for consistency.\n \nKindly suggest an approach to implement StyleCop Code Review at every Check-in from SVN, such that, the check-in only succeeds only if the Code is as per standards defined by the StyleCop rules file (.stylecop).",
