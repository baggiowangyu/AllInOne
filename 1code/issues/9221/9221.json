    "Description": "On Vista (32-bit), the handler didn't work until I'd add the extension's GUID to:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\PreviewHandlers\n \nThe self-registration code had added the entry to the user equivalent location:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\PreviewHandlers\n \n...but that didn't work.\n \nAlso, the project is set to build using the 'C' run-time DLLs, which means you can't just copy the DLL to another machine and register it. It'd be easier if the project built using the non-DLL version of the 'C' run-time.",
