    "Description": "First, I love the WPF Bing Map. I'm creating a .shp file importer and feel dead in my tracts because WPF does not support multi-polygon shapes natively.  I have a simple DataTable with SQLGeometry type that is from the shape file.   \nThe problem is that there's no clean way to get the SQLGeometry into the map! :-)  Polygons are the easiest and I can figure that out; however, multi-polygons are a different story.\nÂ \nCan a class be created to convert a SQLGeometry class to something that can be consumed by WPF/Bing maps control?",
