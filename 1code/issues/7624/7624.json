    "Description": "Code samples tend to be simple and attempt to do one thing. That is mostly good. However, there are times when the whole 9 yards are needed. Here we go.\nIn seprate projects that DO NOT depend on any other frameworks or custom controls. Look: Tekrik's great, but the point is to learn something with all the parts visible and plain for all to see.\n1. A simple DataModel in Entity 4.0 that has navagation objects. Maybe throw in an SP function complex type for a \"cannot be seen on the designer function\"\n2. An MVC project that does the whole CRUD thing including list\n2.1 using Strongly typed views\n2.1.1 with a view model\n2.1.2 with a plain entity\n2.2 CRUD using JSON to JQuery\n2.3 how to track sessions\nfollow each operation down to the end user, and then back up to the server",
