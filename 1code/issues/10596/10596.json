    "Description": "Hello,\nthere does not seem to be a working sample available allowing developers to host the shell preview handlers in their applications, preferably in a WPF one.\n \nI want to note that the ShellThumbnailBrowserDemo of Windows API Code Pack does not host preview handlers, only thumbnails (so you e.g. cannot preview a Word document). Initialization both from files and streams should be supported.\n \nIt would be very helpful to see how this should be done.\nJan",
