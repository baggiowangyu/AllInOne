It is a hard topic that I have encounted it.It seems that it relates to serial points about security. And I have read your thread about this topic in other forum. I think they have the same opinion about it. I will conern on this votes and decide to submit it or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAll-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com ",
