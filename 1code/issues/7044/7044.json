    "Description": "Is it possible to drag and drop data from a C#/.NET application to Excel? Can you provide sample code to perform this?\nMore Info:\nThe drop target is Excel (or Word) and the drop source is a C# application. In detail we would like to know how can the DataObject looks like â€“ and if we can only drop strings or numbers or if we can also drop objects like tables or charts. How can this be achieved and would it be possible to have a sample project which demonstrates this?",
