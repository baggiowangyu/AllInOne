      "Message": "Hello\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting this issue.  It's a known issue of CodePlex that impacts users who use IE to download the clickonce app.  The CodePlex team is trying to fix the problem this week.  The current workaround is to use Chrome or FireFox to install the Sample Browser.  Here is a blog article with more details.  \r\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/codefx/archive/2012/05/27/issue-report-sample-browser-clickonce-installation-is-not-started-in-ie.aspx\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJialiang Ge\r\nProgram Manager\r\nMicrosoft All-In-One Code Framework",

I accepted updating new version and it succeeded. Thanks for your efforts. \r\n\r\nP.S. It is not the official way to ask for samples, but there's already no samples available for VB 2010 and DirectX. More Microsoft's DirectX SDK doesn't provide VB Samples at all.",
