    "Description": "I am looking to save a image to a file in my Win8 store app.  I have the file Serialize a list of other object and would like the image path that was taken by camera or by selecting the image from picture library.  I would like this to populate a particular part of my ListView with all the other parts of the list.  The list populates three textboxes and I would like to add an image to the ListView.  I just need the code to save the image path.\n\nThanks!",
