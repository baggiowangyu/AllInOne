      "Message": "hi mladjenovic,\r\n   I have posted them yesterday. But our team mentor out in redmond have rejected them because of Microsoft's MSDN supporting this issue.You can access the website at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd550721(VS.95).aspx. And I can list my posting original text as follows:\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhat specifically does the sample demo?\r\n\r\nThis sample should demo how to demo local file system accessing as like windows application in trust application  and  XAP signed.Currently the sample has application license validation. Consequently it should list device accessing, which looks like device status(active or inactive) and device information. Finally, the sample should demonstrate auto updating feature using OOB.If possible, the readme of sample should describute how to open the OOB feature with visual studio 2010.It is because that the feature opened is prerequistite conditon.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe sample demos:\r\n\r\n1) How to implement local file system accessing as like windows application in trust application.\r\n\r\n2) How to implement device accessing(device information and status).\r\n\r\n3) How to implement auto updating feature.\r\n\r\n4) How to implement com accessing.\r\n\r\n5)How to implement listing printer and active directory as like local file system \r\n\r\nWhy do we need the content?\r\n\r\nIt is because that our sample issue tracker has this sample idea and its votes beyond 5. It seems that a lot  of customer don't know how to use OOB after silverlight 4 has been promoted.\r\n\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com/workitem/8606\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFinally we all appreciate your sample idea because of being useful for our work and promoting our project. \r\n\r\nHave a nice day\r\nAll-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com\r\n\r\n",

Thank you for your understanding :)\r\n\r\nIf you are expecting a quick technical answer (not just a code sample) for the above Silverlight OOB senarios, you may also consider posting the question to the Silverlight forum. http://forums.silverlight.net/.

Could you please let me know if the information is useful, and we can further discuss if a code sample is necessary to be created in All-In-One Code Framework.\r\n\r\n1. Active Directory login. \r\nAs these answered forum thread discuss (http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/101803/232304.aspx, http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/54590/144184.aspx), there is no support for Active Directory. The workaround is to interact with active directory through a proxy WCF service which can handle direct calls to the AD services.\r\n\r\n2. offline browsing in Silverlight 4.\r\nCould you please clarify \"offline browsing\"? Do you mean offline browsing *webpage* in Silverlight 4?\r\n\r\n3. check for available network connection. (i.e., check weather the server is alive or not) \r\nTo check if network connectivity is available, you can call the NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable method.\r\nTo check if a certain HTTP web server is available, you may consider sending an HTTP Web Request to the server, and check the response. \r\nThere is a code example in the MSDN page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httpwebrequest(v=vs.95).aspx#Y2539  \r\n(see the Examples section)",
