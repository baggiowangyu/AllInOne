How to set its direction?\nCan I use WinCE APIs for my Application?\n \nI have tried CreateFile\nhComm = CreateFile(\".\\\\COM\" + PortNum, GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, 0, 0, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, 0);\nI am unable to create COM Port and register it to existing bluetooth stack.\n \nIf I have a com port created using some 3rd party application then how to register it to bluetooth stack?\n \nPlatform I am using:\nOperating System: Win Vista 32bit\nBluetooth Stack: Widcomm",
