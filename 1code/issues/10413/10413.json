The problem comes when I get to the InstallDate field. I have searched a great deal of documentation and web sites looking for how to read the value of this field by using \n  IWbemClassObject::Get() \nto return a variant value for this field but none of the values within the resulting VARIANT type is meaningful.\n \nCan you please provide a sample which makes this date time useful? An additional example of how to set it properly as well would be useful as I'm writing a RIP daemon (yes, I know, it's educational so I'll better understand the protocol)",
