    "Description": "Hello fellow comunity members,\n \nI'm using VB.NET as well as the \"R\" language for academic reasons.\nR has every mathematical function known to man available with just one command, but lacks a user interface.\nVB.NET is a powerful language, has astonishing user interface but lacks nearly all mathematical functions.\n \nI want to use \"R\" from VB.NET, so as to create freeware programs for my university with a user interface.\nStatconnDCOM is a program doing this very thing, enabling users to use R from any programing language, but its license has too many limitations, and the creator of it told me that it might not always be free.\nI cant create a freeware program, and later on tell the university that, hey, you know.. i never said it's gonna be free for ever.\n \nIs there any other way to connect R with VB.NET ??",
