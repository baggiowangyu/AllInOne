    "Description": "I spent at least several hours researching how I could do my particular task but found no efficient way of doing it. Here is my request...I populate a DataGridView with a dataset from a SQL server database. That works well but i would like to autosize the columns by default to present to the user. Then if the user wants they can resize the columns. It seems like you can do either one or the other with the built in autosize methods but not both. I can autosize the columns but then they become locked and the user cannot resize. \nÂ \nAGP",

      "Message": "Hello AGP,\r\nThank you for using our code sample request service. \r\n\r\nI'd like to confirm with you my understanding of the sample request:\r\n\r\nYou describute a scenario,which use the property of DataGridView like AutoResizeRowHeadersWidth. This time, It is a wonderful idea that you want to make them all resizing by yourself according to taking the mouse cursor into boundary of column.I think it should make a trick at event delegate.\r\n\r\nIs my understanding correct? Please let me know if I misunderstood your needs.\r\nThis looks a request of a DataGridView code sample.  Let's see how many people will vote for it. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAll-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com \r\n",

After i do that then i also want the user to be able to resize if they wouold like to do so. Right now if I autosize the columns they become frozen and the user cannot inyteract with the column width.",
