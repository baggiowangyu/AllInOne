      "Message": "Hello Kira\r\n\r\nThank you for using our code sample request service. \r\n\r\nBased on my understanding, your request consists of two technical points:\r\n\r\n1) How to  support drag&drop in TabControl of WinForms\r\n2) How to create a thumbnail image of a tab page, and show the thumbnail image while user is dragging a tab. \r\n\r\nIf I misunderstood your requirement, please let me know. My team is evaluating the requirement. It would take some time. To help you quickly get started, here is a code sample from codeproject that demonstrates the tech point 1 (drag&drop in TabControl). And here is a forum thread talking about how to generate a thumbnail image from a Winform control. \r\n\r\nI hope that you have a wonderful day! \r\nThanks\r\nMicrosoft All-In-One Code Framework\r\nhttp://1code.codeplex.com\r\n",
