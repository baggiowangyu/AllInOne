    "Description": "Right now the documentation on WFD is very slim.  We have some function documentation here:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms706274(v=vs.85).aspx\nbut nothing documenting a workflow of how to use those functions in concert.  The sample that is downloadable from here:\nhttp://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Proximity-Sample-88129731#content\nis unfortunately not very comprehensive and seems directly specifically at using Proximety devices.  While this specificity isn't terrible, it would be more useful to how WFD would be designed in a typical Desktop environment.\n\nWFD appears to be a powerful new standard in its early days of life.  Empowering users to take hold of this technology on Microsoft/Windows systems will help the Windows platform to claim significant presence in what may be a very important new field of development.  Connecting machines simply and exchanging data at any time is going to be a staple of future consumer technology.  Providing these samples will make sure that Windows is a part of that.",
