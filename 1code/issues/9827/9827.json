Because we already have a WebDownloader sample that demonstrate Pause/Resume/Cancel/Stop/Multi-Thread,the sample name is CSMultiThreadedWebDownloader and CSWebDownloader.If we have no additional features about it, I am afraid I can't persuade our experts approve this sample idea,so you'd better providing more scenario about its extend features.

Would you please give me more information about its detailed technologies points such as MVP 's blog articles or other some kb articles. I believe refining from these articles can make more clear the brain to understand its features and describe it more comprehensive,so that the SMEs will approve it immediately when I  complete its contents and submit it to Subject Matter Experts.Thanks in advanced.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAll-In-Onecode-Framework",
