    "Description": "In Windows Azure, the main hosting process (WaWebHost or WaWorkerHost) is associated with a job object, which imposes certain limitations such as unable to use most features of GDI+. The only workaround is to create a new process using Win32_Process.Create that is not associated with the job object.\n \nWe request a managed code sample which demonstrates the following features:\n \nHow to create a job object that has the JobObjectBasicUIRestrictions limit.\nUse Process.Start to create a new process associated with the job object.\nDemonstrate you can't perform certain tasks, such as obtaining an external window handle, in the process.\nUse Win32_Process.Create to start a new process which is not associated with the job object.\nDemonstrate you can perform certain tasks, such as obtaining an external window handle, in the process.\n \nThe sample should be a web application, rather than a desktop application.",
