    "Description": "It would be nice to have a sample of rendering PerformancePoint scorecard indicator (at least correct picture of the indicator, e.g. red/green/yellow). I've found \n\nBIMonitoringServiceApplicationProxy.RenderScorecard() method\n\nthat returns HTML markup and JavaScript code, from which I could extract needed indicator's data, but it's not clear how to prepare parameters for the method. Especially, parameter WebPartContext. It has a few complex properties.\n\nThe sample will be very useful! Its code will allow to render PPS indicators in SharePoint custom fields and other places.",
