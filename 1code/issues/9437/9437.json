    "Description": "Hello,\n \nThe request:\nFind an dynamic attached device and communicate to it.\n \nThe problem:\nA problem raise @ work that took a bunch of people to investigate. We got a device intalled with correct driver but we wrote a program to communicate to it as the one that cames with didn't suit our needs. Despite all the documentation no one in the Team could help in C#. As we have the chipset and the documentation of it, we are now thinking to write a very basic driver ourselves.\n \nRegards,\ncpg",
