See WindowsAPICodePack\\Samples\\Shell\\ShellThumbnailBrowserDemo. So my team will probably not duplicate the sample in All-In-One Code Framework. Please let me know whether ShellThumbnailBrowserDemo is helpful to you. If you have any additional requirement, please let me know. \r\n",

Also, it would be nice to see how a 64 bit application can preview *.msg files on a system that has 32bit Office installed. 64 bit Windows Explorer seems to use a 32 bit 'prevhost.exe' process but it's unclear how you would do that in your own application.",
