    "Description": "Coming from VB6 as a development language I have converted most of my apps to VB.NET. The only thing that I have struggled with is how to display an Excel chart inside a WinForm. In VB6 I could use an OLE container to directly link with a chart in Excel. i could then manipulate the chart and then refresh the link and the chart would be displayed within my form. I have yet to fond a good an efficient way to do this in VB.NET. Ive read several blog articles on how to do this but all have failed in my particular case.\nÂ \nAGP",

      "Message": "Sveral things, I develop in VS2005 and have tried the browser method. it does not work in all cases. it depends on how you have IE setup as the chart can sometimes not display due to IT security settings or sometimes it will display in a pop-up window rather than inside the form. I have tested at my company and the result was not favorable. \r\n\r\nFor VS2008 can you post a sample or link on how i can achieve this without the browser component?\r\n\r\nAGP",
