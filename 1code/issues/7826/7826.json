    "Description": "I have a scenario where I want to use the script loader functionality in the Start.js file to load some 3rd party scripts, but I also want to use the script manager for the ajax control toolkit on the same page(s). This is to be included on a master page for use by the entire site I'm making. Is there a good way to do this or do I have to choose one way or the other?",
