I'd like to know if the official SkyDrive code samples published on http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/ff621314 have met your requirement?  Our team tries not to duplicate the effort of the official MSDN samples.  If you have specific programming tasks that are not demoed in the official MSDN samples, please let us know.  We will evaluate them and try providing the code samples in Microsoft All-In-One Code Framework.\r\n\r\nThanks again and have a nice day!\r\nJialiang Ge\r\nProgram Manager\r\nMicrosoft All-In-One Code Framework.",
