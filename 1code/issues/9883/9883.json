      "Message": "I'm talking about a way to tell online users, or registered users to know on how much bandwidth they are consuming on per page reload or while they are downloading content from a website. I windows it might be possible and is possible using tools but online, at least I haven't seen such feature.\r\n\r\nTake facebook as an example, every user that have a profile has a different content on there profile, so there should be a way to detect on how much data they are requesting and is sent to per user. and what type it is, video, html, scripts, or songs, images, etc.. graph that should represent that in MB | GB. No such website I am aware of has such feature. This is useful if you can also manage to display then you can also analyze a lot of information regarding per user based info, what the user finds interested in on a site.",
