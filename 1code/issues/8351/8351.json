    "Description": "Apparently, WPF provides Page and PageFunction as loose analogues to the MFC PropertySheet and PropertyPage classes. While these are very powerful, it's not clear what the best way is to use them to construct a classic Windows task wizard.\n \nPlease create a sample showing a three-page wizard, using best practices, showing Back, Next, Cancel, and Finish buttons and some simple properties being set on each page of the wizard.\n \nThank you.",
