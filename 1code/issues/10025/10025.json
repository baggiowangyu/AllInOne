    "Description": "I am trying to create a DLL which contain a Thumbnail.png image. I set the image as \"Embedded Resource\", because I want to refer the dll in another C# metro Main project to load the image. I have tried several methods.\n1. The first situation：\nCode in the C# Class Library project (the project name is MusicData) as follow:\nBitmapImage bitmap = new BitmapImage(new Uri(\"ms-resource://MusicData/Files/Images/Thumbnail.png\"));\nSet \"Content\" as Build Action for the image.\nThen in C# metro Main project, select the MusicData Class Library project as the reference.\nAs that, I can load the image successful in the Main project.\n \n2. The second situation：\nCode as follow:\nBitmapImage bitmap = new BitmapImage(new Uri(\"/MusicData;component/Images/Thumbnail.png\", UriKind.Relative));\nSet \"Embedded Resource\" as Build Action for the image.\nThen in C# metro Main project, select the MusicData.dll as the reference.\nBut I can not load the image in Main metro project.\n \nThe second situation is I actually wanted! The Main metro project just needed the MusicData.dll not the whole Class Library Project.\nHelp me please...",
